# ETG---LINEAR-REGRESSION

### IMPLEMENTION OF LINEAR REGRESSION USING SCIKIT-LEARN PYTHON LIBRARY TO PREDICT ROAD TRIP DURATION(S) BASED ON THE DISTANCE(M) 

- Linear regression is a regression model that estimates the relationship between independent variables and dependent variable using a straight line
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL from scikit-learn python library, the pre-processed data are trained and tested
- Finally, the accuracy of the trained model is predicted
